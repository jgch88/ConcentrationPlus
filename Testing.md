## Unit Tests with XCTest

- `@testable import Concentration` seems to be importing the whole project, not just the class
- tests are written as functions prefixed with test, e.g. `func testGameInitialization() { ... }`
- use `XCTAssert` matchers
- difficult to mock in Swift due to no "reflection" capabilities
